# integration-mini-projects
Ideas and tracking for small one week "mini projects" that integrate across IPFS working groups and software.

# What is this?

This is a place where anybody is welcome to pitch ideas for "mini projects" that exercise parts of IPFS and show what the software is capable of.

Ideally, a "mini project" is something that could be completed within a normal week for a single person, assuming they also have other regular tasks, meetings, etc.

Some things that could be a mini project:

* write some code that exercises a new IPFS feature
* try to build a demo app that uses a new open source library created by people from within the IPFS community
* freshen up dependencies on an IPFS related tool that hasn't been updated for a while
* create some targeted documentation to support a collaboration partner
* try out novel combinations of software to see if they work together
* build a simulation to duplicate a particular problematic scenario where the IPFS swarm is failing in some way (performance, etc.)
* a "proof of concept" of something that would take much more than one week to finish
* write an in-depth blog post on a topic
* develop a ProtoSchool module
* fixing an urgent bug that is affecting users

Mini-projects might also be things that "fell through the cracks" during planning, or are things that are hard to figure out what working group should do it, or things that need a rapid response and weren't predicted at OKR planning time.

# Brainstorm!

Feel free to use the [Brainstorming](https://github.com/ipfs/integration-mini-projects/wiki/Brainstorming) page on the wiki to record your free-form thoughts. If people are interested, we could organize some collaborative brainstorming sessions to come up with new ideas.

# Submit your ideas!

Do you have an idea? Submit it as a github issue on this repository.

* [Submit New Issue](https://github.com/ipfs/integration-mini-projects/issues/new)
  
Want to add to a proposed idea? Feel free to add a comment to [any issue](https://github.com/ipfs/integration-mini-projects/issues).

Use any format you want when submitting the issue.

# Enhance!

We encourage everybody to look at the issues, and try to add things to them:

* additional context about the problem
* description of the potential impact
* links to similar or prior work
* identify the audience
* identity stakeholders that might want a say in how the mini project is set up
* narratives and stories

# Nominate, Green Light, Resource and Ship

Hopefully, some of the ideas will have good discussion and will eventually progress beyong the "half-baked" stage ... we will want to move forward with them. We'd like to define a semi-formal but lightweight process for "nominating" ideas for consideration as proposals.

As of 2019 Q3, there are no resources allocated to work on these projects, but feel free to use this repo as a place to collect ideas.

Also please use [ipfs/notes](https://github.com/ipfs/notes) as a place for new ideas!

# Final notes

For now, this is an experiment. We might continue this if it works out well, or do something completely different in the future.
